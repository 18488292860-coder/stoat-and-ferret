## Instructions

Read and follow the master prompt at `docs/auto-dev/PROMPTS/retrospective_prompt/000-master-prompt.md` to execute the Post-Version Retrospective against **version v006** of the stoat-and-ferret project.

The master prompt contains all the detailed steps, phases, and output requirements. Follow it exactly.

## Output Requirements

At minimum, produce a `README.md` in that directory summarizing what was done and linking to all generated artifacts.

## Commit Instructions

After generating all retrospective artifacts, commit the results with a descriptive commit message referencing v006.
