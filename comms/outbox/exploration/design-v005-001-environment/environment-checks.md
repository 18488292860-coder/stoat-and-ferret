## C4 Architecture Documentation

No C4 documentation exists in the project. Searched `docs/C4-Documentation/` and `docs/**/C4*` - no files found. BL-018 (P2, version-agnostic) tracks creation of C4 architecture documentation.

## Verdict

All checks pass. Environment is ready for v005 design work.
