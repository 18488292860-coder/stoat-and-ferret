# v005 Validation Discrepancies

## Non-Blocking Issues Found

### 1. Template-Generated Top-Level Documents (Content Completeness)

**VERSION_DESIGN.md** and **THEME_INDEX.md** were generated by the `design_version` MCP tool using its template format rather than being copied from the Task 007 drafts.

- VERSION_DESIGN.md is missing: Key Technical Decisions table, Execution Order diagram, Risks summary table, Dependencies section, References section
- THEME_INDEX.md has placeholder `_Feature description_` for all 11 features

**Impact:** Low. All this information exists in the THEME_DESIGN.md files and individual feature documents. The top-level documents serve as entry points, not the authoritative source for detailed content.

**Remediation (if desired):** Replace the template-generated VERSION_DESIGN.md with the draft from `comms/outbox/exploration/design-v005-007-drafts/drafts/VERSION_DESIGN.md`. Update THEME_INDEX.md feature descriptions from the draft.

### 2. Incorrect File References in Theme 02 Feature 002

**File:** `02-backend-services/002-pagination-total-count/implementation-plan.md`

| Referenced File | Actual File |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `src/stoat_ferret/db/async_sqlite_repository.py` | `src/stoat_ferret/db/async_repository.py` |
| `src/stoat_ferret/db/async_inmemory_repository.py` | `src/stoat_ferret/db/async_repository.py` |
| `tests/test_repository.py` | `tests/test_repository_contract.py` or `tests/test_async_repository_contract.py` |
| `tests/test_videos_router.py` | Tests in `tests/test_api/` directory |

**Impact:** Low. The class names and modification intent are clear. The implementing agent will locate the correct files by searching for the class definitions.

### 3. test_settings.py Marked as Modify

**File:** `01-frontend-foundation/003-settings-and-docs/implementation-plan.md`

References `tests/test_settings.py` as a file to "Modify" but no such file exists. This should be "Create" with the described test content.

**Impact:** Very low. Self-correcting during implementation.

### 4. Missing static/ Directory

**File:** `02-backend-services/001-thumbnail-pipeline/implementation-plan.md`

References creating `static/placeholder-thumb.jpg` but `static/` directory doesn't exist at the project root.

**Impact:** Very low. The implementing agent will create the directory.

### 5. Protocol Breaking Change Not Explicitly Flagged

**File:** `02-backend-services/002-pagination-total-count/implementation-plan.md`

Adding `count()` to `AsyncVideoRepository` protocol is a protocol-level change. While the plan correctly lists both implementations that need updating, the risk section doesn't call this out as a breaking change.

**Impact:** Very low. Both implementations are in-tree and the plan covers updating both.

### 6. Minor Detail Losses in Notes Propagation

Three minor details from the design research were not carried into execution documents:
- R-4: BL-032 AC#1 explicit flexibility rationale not cited
- R-4: `AsyncioJobQueue` class name not mentioned (essential insight preserved)
- UQ-4: "Ratchet up in v006+" forward planning note not carried

**Impact:** None. All essential context is preserved. These are implementation-specific class names and future-version planning notes.
