## Summary

Environment verification and context gathering for v006 design. All checks passed — environment is ready.

## Artifacts Produced

All outputs saved to `comms/outbox/versions/design/v006/001-environment/`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| README.md | Environment status summary, project/git status, architecture context, version scope |
| environment-checks.md | Detailed results from health check, project config, git status, C4 docs review |
| version-context.md | v006 goals, backlog items (BL-037–043), dependency chain, constraints, deferred items |

## Key Findings
