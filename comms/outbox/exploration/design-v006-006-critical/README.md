# Exploration: design-v006-006-critical

Critical thinking and risk investigation for v006 effects engine foundation design.

## What Was Produced

All outputs saved to `comms/outbox/versions/design/v006/006-critical-thinking/`:

1. **risk-assessment.md** — Detailed assessment of all 5 risks from Task 005 with investigation findings, evidence, and resolutions
2. **refined-logical-design.md** — Updated logical design incorporating risk resolutions (same structure as Task 005, with within-feature refinements)
3. **investigation-log.md** — Full log of all codebase queries, searches, and evidence gathered during investigation
4. **README.md** — Summary of critical thinking review with confidence assessment

## Key Findings

- 2 of 5 risks resolved via investigation (clip effect model, FilterGraph compatibility)
- 3 risks accepted with concrete mitigations (coverage ratchet, font handling, boxborderw)
- No structural design changes needed — Task 005's 3-theme, 8-feature design is confirmed
- High confidence in design readiness for document drafting (Task 007)
