# Discrepancies - v006 Pre-Execution Validation

## Non-Blocking Discrepancies

### 1. VERSION_DESIGN.md — Content Restructuring

**Type:** Non-blocking warning
**Severity:** Low

The persisted VERSION_DESIGN.md was generated by the `design_version` MCP tool using its own template, rather than being a direct copy of the Task 007 draft. Two sections from the draft are absent:

- **Design Artifacts section** — Lists 6 design analysis directories (`001-environment` through `006-critical-thinking`). The executing agent may not discover these reference documents as easily.
- **Key Design Decisions section** — 7 specific implementation decisions (Expr enum modeling, Kahn's algorithm inline, opt-in validate(), JSON-in-TEXT effects, DI pattern, single-value boxborderw, font/fontfile dual support). These serve as implementation guard rails.

**Impact:** Low. The Design Artifacts are accessible via the design artifact store directly (`comms/outbox/versions/design/v006/`). The Key Design Decisions are documented in the risk assessment (`006-critical-thinking/risk-assessment.md`) and referenced from THEME_DESIGN files.

**Remediation if needed:** Could re-run Task 008 (persist) to include these sections, but the information is available through other paths.

### 2. THEME_INDEX.md — Missing Per-Theme Metadata

**Type:** Non-blocking warning
**Severity:** Low

The persisted THEME_INDEX.md omits per-theme `**Backlog Items:**` and `**Dependencies:**` lines that were in the draft.

**Impact:** Minimal. This information is present in each theme's THEME_DESIGN.md file, which the executing agent reads before starting each theme.

### 3. Theme 02 Dependency Overstatement

**Type:** Non-blocking observation
**Severity:** Informational

Theme 02 THEME_DESIGN states "both builders consume the expression engine" but the speed-builders do not use the `Expr` type system from Theme 01's expression-engine. Only the drawtext-builder depends on it (for alpha animation expressions).

**Impact:** None. The dependency is overstated (conservative), not understated. Sequential execution is not affected.

## No Blocking Discrepancies Identified

All 13 checklist items pass. No issues require remediation before execution.
