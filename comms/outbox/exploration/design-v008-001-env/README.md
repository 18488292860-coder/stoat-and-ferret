# Exploration: design-v008-001-env

Environment verification and context gathering for v008 version design.

## What Was Produced

Three artifacts saved to `comms/outbox/versions/design/v008/001-environment/`:

1. **README.md** — Summary of environment status (ready) and v008 scope overview
2. **environment-checks.md** — Detailed results from health check, project config, git status, and C4 architecture review
3. **version-context.md** — v008 goals, backlog item IDs (BL-055/056/058/062), theme structure, dependencies, risks, and deferred items

## Key Findings

- Environment is **ready** for v008 design — all checks pass
- Project is idle with no active themes or executions
- Git is on `main`, fully synced with remote
- C4 architecture documentation is current through v007
- v008 targets 4 backlog items across 2 themes (startup wiring + CI stability)
