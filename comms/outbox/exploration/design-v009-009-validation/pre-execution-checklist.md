# Pre-Execution Validation Checklist - v009

## Checklist

- [x] **Content completeness** — Drafts match persisted documents.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: All 14 feature documents (requirements.md + implementation-plan.md) are identical between Task 007 drafts and persisted inbox. VERSION_DESIGN.md and THEME_INDEX.md have different formats (persisted versions generated by MCP tools) but contain the same core information. Both THEME_DESIGN.md files are identical. No truncation or missing content detected.

- [x] **Reference resolution** — Design artifact store references resolve.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: All 6 design artifact store references resolve to existing files: 006-critical-thinking/risk-assessment.md, 006-critical-thinking/investigation-log.md, 004-research/codebase-patterns.md, 004-research/evidence-log.md, 005-logical-design/test-strategy.md, 001-environment/version-context.md.

- [x] **Notes propagation** — Backlog notes in feature requirements.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: Only BL-057 had notes ("Depends on BL-056 (completed in v008). Use RotatingFileHandler with maxBytes=10MB."). These are properly reflected in file-logging requirements.md: background section mentions BL-056 dependency and FR-002 specifies maxBytes=10_485_760. All other backlog items had "Notes: None". Impact summary items (documentation updates, caller wiring) are documented in the design artifact store.

- [x] **validate_version_design passes** — 0 missing documents.
  - Status: PASS
  - Result: `{"valid": true, "themes_validated": 2, "features_validated": 6, "documents": {"found": 18, "missing": []}}`

- [x] **Backlog alignment** — Features reference correct BL-XXX items.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: All 6 backlog items from manifest.json are mapped to features with matching acceptance criteria:
    - BL-057 → 003-file-logging (AC1-AC6 all covered by FR-001 through FR-006)
    - BL-059 → 001-ffmpeg-observability (AC1-AC4 covered by FR-001 through FR-004 + NFR-001)
    - BL-060 → 002-audit-logging (AC1-AC3 covered by FR-001 through FR-004)
    - BL-063 → 001-spa-routing (AC1-AC3 covered by FR-001 through FR-006)
    - BL-064 → 002-pagination-fix (AC1-AC3 covered by FR-001 through FR-005)
    - BL-065 → 003-websocket-broadcasts (AC1-AC4 covered by FR-001 through FR-004)
    - `deferred_items: []` — no items deferred or descoped.

- [x] **File paths exist** — Implementation plans reference real files.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: All 26 referenced files verified to exist: 20 source/test files to be modified + 6 design artifact store references. Files to be created (new test files) have parent directories that exist.

- [x] **Dependency accuracy** — No circular or incorrect dependencies.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: Theme 1 before Theme 2 (avoid concurrent app.py modifications). Theme 1 features sequential (001 → 002 → 003) to avoid concurrent app.py mods. Theme 2 features sequenced by priority/complexity. BL-057 depends on BL-056 (completed in v008). No circular dependencies. No cross-theme functional dependencies.

- [x] **Mitigation strategy** — Workarounds documented if needed.
  - Status: N/A
  - Notes: v009 implements wiring gaps, not bug fixes. No bugs affecting execution to mitigate. Risks are documented in 005-logical-design/risks-and-unknowns.md and 006-critical-thinking/risk-assessment.md with clear mitigations for each (AuditLogger sync connection, SPA route ordering, lifespan complexity, test double injection).

- [x] **Design docs committed** — All inbox documents committed.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: `git status` shows only 1 modified file: `comms/state/explorations/design-v009-009-validation-1771772973268.json` (current exploration state, not a design document). All 18 documents in `comms/inbox/versions/execution/v009/` and all documents in `comms/outbox/versions/design/v009/` are committed.

- [x] **Handover document** — STARTER_PROMPT.md complete.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: STARTER_PROMPT.md exists at `comms/inbox/versions/execution/v009/STARTER_PROMPT.md`. Contains: project context reference (AGENTS.md), execution process (read THEME_INDEX, execute themes in order), status tracking instructions (STATUS.md), output document requirements (completion-report.md, quality-gaps.md, handoff-to-next.md), and quality gates (ruff, mypy, pytest).

- [x] **Impact analysis** — Dependencies, breaking changes, test impact.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: VERSION_DESIGN.md documents theme dependencies and constraints. Impact summary (003-impact-assessment/impact-summary.md) identifies 10 impacts across 3 categories. Breaking changes documented: SPA route replaces StaticFiles mount, `total` field value changes from page-size to true count. Test impact assessed: pagination test assertions need updating (test_blackbox/test_edge_cases.py). Risks-and-unknowns.md covers 6 risks and 1 unknown with mitigations.

- [x] **Naming convention** — Theme/feature folders match patterns, no double-numbering.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: 2 theme folders match `^\d{2}-[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$`: 01-observability-pipeline, 02-gui-runtime-fixes. 6 feature folders match `^\d{3}-[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$`: 001-ffmpeg-observability, 002-audit-logging, 003-file-logging, 001-spa-routing, 002-pagination-fix, 003-websocket-broadcasts. No double-numbered prefixes detected.

- [x] **Cross-reference consistency** — THEME_INDEX matches folder structure exactly.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: Perfect bidirectional consistency. 2 themes in index, 2 on disk. 6 features in index, 6 on disk. All names match exactly (case-sensitive). Forward and reverse matches confirmed for all entries.

- [x] **No MCP tool references** — Feature docs do not instruct MCP tool calls.
  - Status: PASS
  - Notes: Grep scan of all documents in `comms/inbox/versions/execution/v009/` for MCP tool function names (save_learning, add_backlog_item, query_cli_sessions, etc.) returned 0 matches.
