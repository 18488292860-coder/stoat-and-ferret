4 closure tasks completed, 1 document updated (PLAN.md). CHANGELOG verified complete with no corrections needed. README reviewed with no changes required. Repository clean with no stale branches or open PRs.

## Results

- **PLAN.md**: Updated. Marked v004 as complete in version table, moved v004 from Planned to Completed Versions section with summary, updated Current Focus from v003 to v005, added change log entry.
- **CHANGELOG**: Verified complete. All entries cross-referenced against 5 theme retrospectives (test-foundation, blackbox-contract, async-scan, security-performance, devex-coverage). Added/Changed/Fixed sections accurately reflect 15 features across 5 themes. No corrections needed.
- **README**: No changes needed. v004 delivered internal quality infrastructure (test doubles, DI, contract tests, security audit, benchmarks, Docker). No user-facing capabilities were added or changed. The project description ("AI-driven video editor with hybrid Python/Rust architecture") remains accurate.
- **Repository**: Clean. No open PRs related to v004 (all 15 PRs #48-#62 merged). No stale branches (only `main` exists). Working tree clean (only exploration state file from this task).
