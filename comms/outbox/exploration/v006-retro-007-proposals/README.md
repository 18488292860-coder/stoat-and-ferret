# Exploration: v006-retro-007-proposals

Synthesized findings from v006 retrospective tasks 001-006 into a proposals document. v006 "Effects Engine Foundation" was exceptionally clean: all quality gates pass, all documentation present, all backlog items completed, no architecture drift, learnings extracted successfully.

## Produced

- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v006/007-proposals/README.md` — Summary with status-by-task table, immediate fixes, backlog references
- `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v006/007-proposals/proposals.md` — Complete proposals document in Crystal Clear Actions format

## Key Results

- **1 finding** requiring action: BL-018 ("Create C4 architecture documentation") is still open but C4 docs were created in v005 and updated in v006 — proposed for closure
- **0 quality gate backlog items** needed (all gates passed cleanly)
- **0 user actions** required
- **5 of 6 tasks** had zero findings
