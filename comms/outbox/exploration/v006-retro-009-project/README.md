# Exploration: v006-retro-009-project

Project-specific closure evaluation for v006 (Effects Engine Foundation). Evaluated 6 closure areas against the version's 3 themes and 8 features. No project-specific closure needs were identified.

## Artifacts Produced

| Artifact | Path | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Closure README | `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v006/009-project-closure/README.md` | Full closure evaluation with area-by-area assessment |

## Summary

- VERSION_CLOSURE.md was absent — evaluation performed based on actual version changes
- All 6 closure areas evaluated: prompt templates, MCP tools, configuration schemas, shared utilities, new files/patterns, cross-project tooling
- No closure needs found — v006 updated its own architecture docs in-version (theme 03, feature 003) and general closure was handled by task 008
- No new backlog items created (no genuine closure gaps identified)
