# Exploration: v007-retro-003-backlog

## Summary

Backlog verification for v007 retrospective. Cross-referenced all BL-XXX items from PLAN.md and feature requirements, verified statuses, and completed open items.

## What Was Produced

Artifacts saved to `comms/outbox/versions/retrospective/v007/003-backlog/`:

- **README.md** — Verification summary: 9 items checked, 9 completed, 0 already complete, 0 unplanned, 1 orphaned item (BL-055), plus hygiene observations (staleness, tag consistency, size calibration).
- **backlog-report.md** — Detailed table of all 9 items with before/after status, feature mapping, open items remaining, and investigation dependency updates.

## Key Findings

- All 9 planned v007 items (BL-044 through BL-052) were still "open" despite features being completed. All 9 were marked completed by this task.
- Perfect alignment between PLAN.md and feature requirements — no unplanned items found.
- BL-055 (P0 flaky E2E test) discovered during v007 execution remains open as a bug fix item.
- No stale backlog items (oldest is 24 days old). No size calibration concerns.
