# Exploration: v008-retro-009-project

Project-specific closure evaluation for v008 completed. No closure needs identified — v008 was a focused maintenance version that wired existing infrastructure and fixed a flaky E2E test, with no cross-cutting or external-facing impact.

## Artifacts Produced

| Artifact | Path | Description |

- All v008 changes are internal wiring or isolated test fixes with no downstream impact
