# Impact Assessment Table - v007

| # | Area | Description | Classification | Resulting Work Item | Caused By |
|---|------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 1 | 02-architecture.md | Rust Core Responsibilities section (lines 139-151) lists only drawtext and speed control builders; will be missing audio mixing and transition builders | small | Add audio/transition builders to Rust Core Responsibilities list | BL-044, BL-045 |
| 2 | 02-architecture.md | Effects Service section (lines 356-382) only lists text_overlay and speed_control as built-in effects; registry architecture description will be fundamentally outdated after registry overhaul | substantial | Rewrite Effects Service section to reflect registry-based dispatch, JSON schema validation, builder protocol, and all registered effects | BL-044, BL-045, BL-047 |
| 3 | 02-architecture.md | Rust module structure (lines 400-417) missing audio and transition modules under ffmpeg/ | small | Add audio.rs and transitions.rs to Rust module structure listing | BL-044, BL-045 |
| 4 | 02-architecture.md | PyO3 bindings section (lines 576-596) only shows DrawtextBuilder and SpeedControl; audio/transition builder classes missing | small | Add audio and transition builder classes to PyO3 bindings section | BL-044, BL-045 |
| 5 | 02-architecture.md | Registered effects table (lines 921-928) only shows 2 effects (text_overlay, speed_control); will have 4+ after v007 | small | Add audio mixing and transition effects to registered effects table | BL-044, BL-045, BL-047 |
| 6 | 02-architecture.md | EffectDefinition schema section (lines 906-920) describes current dataclass; may need updating for enhanced registry with JSON schema validation and builder protocol | small | Update EffectDefinition schema section to reflect registry enhancements if schema changes | BL-047 |
| 7 | 02-architecture.md | Prometheus metrics list (lines 188-196) missing effect-specific metrics; BL-047 adds effect_applications_total counter | small | Add effect_applications_total metric to Prometheus metrics list | BL-047 |
| 8 | 05-api-specification.md | Effects discovery response (lines 655-714) only shows text_overlay and speed_control examples; audio and transition effects missing | small | Add audio and transition effect examples to discovery response | BL-044, BL-045, BL-047 |
| 9 | 05-api-specification.md | "Future: Preview Effect Filter" section (lines 762-768) marked "Not yet implemented"; BL-050 will implement this endpoint | small | Remove "Future" label and "Not yet implemented" note; document actual preview endpoint | BL-050 |
| 10 | 05-api-specification.md | "Future: Update/Delete Effect" section (lines 770-778) marked "Not yet implemented" with note "effects are append-only"; BL-051 will implement CRUD endpoints | small | Remove "Future" label; document actual PATCH/DELETE effect endpoints with request/response schemas | BL-051 |
| 11 | 05-api-specification.md | No transition-specific endpoint documented; BL-046 adds POST /effects/transition for clip-to-clip transitions | substantial | Add full /effects/transition endpoint documentation with request/response schemas and examples | BL-046 |
| 12 | 01-roadmap.md | Phase 2 milestones 2.4 (audio), 2.5 (transitions), 2.8 (GUI discovery), 2.9 (GUI builder) will have items completed | small | Update milestone checkboxes for completed items | BL-044 through BL-052 |
| 13 | 08-gui-architecture.md | Phase 2 milestones 2.1 and 2.2 will have GUI items completed | small | Update milestone checkboxes for completed GUI items | BL-048 through BL-051 |
