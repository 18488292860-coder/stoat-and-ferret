      "description": "14 unique orphaned WebFetch tool_use calls reported across 11 sessions. Investigation (pr001-webfetch-breakdown) found only 5 of 14 belong to stoat-and-ferret (v002: 2, v006: 3). The remaining 9 were cross-project contamination (kb-store 4, auto-dev-mcp 4, gw-test 1) due to health check querying with scope=all. Impact was low \u2014 sessions were killed quickly. Root cause: WebFetch has no timeout + agents fetch URLs that won't return (GitHub pages, auth-walled sites). Addressed globally by auto-dev-mcp BL-536.",

      "description": "34 unique orphaned tool calls (tool_use without tool_result) across 7 tool types: Bash (11), TaskOutput (8), Task (7), Read (6), Edit (1), Grep (1), Write (1). Investigation (pr002-orphaned-tools-breakdown) found only 4 of 28 affected sessions belong to stoat-and-ferret. 69% of orphans are blocking waits (sleep commands, TaskOutput polling, pytest runs) \u2014 normal session termination during long operations. Zero correlation with WebFetch orphans (PR-001), confirming independent causes. Lost work risk minimal: 33 of 35 orphans are non-destructive; only 1 Edit and 1 Write on non-production files carry moderate risk. Also flagged 3x row inflation from duplicate tool_use_ids in the ingestion pipeline. No action required for data integrity \u2014 these represent normal session lifecycle patterns.",
